# Snake_Game
This is a simple snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to control a snake and eat the food that appears on the screen while avoiding collision with the walls and the snake's own body.

# How to Play------
Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake.
The snake will move in the direction of the arrow key pressed.
The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
